# CreateInit

This Create Init plugin for Sublime Text to auto create `__init__.py` that import all python files into `__all__`

# Plugin Installation
**With the Package Control plugin:** The easiest way to install
`CreateInit` is through Package Control, which can be found at this site: <http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control>

Once you install Package Control, restart Sublime Text and bring up the
Command Palette (`Command+Shift+P` on OS X, `Control+Shift+P` on
Linux/Windows). Select "Package Control: Install Package", wait while
Package Control fetches the latest package list, then select
`CreateInit` when the list appears. The advantage of using this
method is that Package Control will automatically keep CreateInit
up to date with the latest version.

**Without Git:** Download the latest source from [GitHub](https://github.com/Boris-code/CreateInit) and copy
the whole directory into the Packages directory.

**With Git:** Clone the repository in your Sublime Text Packages directory, located somewhere in user's "Home" directory:

    git clone https://github.com/Boris-code/CreateInit.git
The "Packages" packages directory is located differently in different
platforms. To access the directory use:

-   OS X:

        Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Browse Packages...

-   Linux:

        Preferences -> Browse Packages...

-   Windows:

        Preferences -> Browse Packages...
